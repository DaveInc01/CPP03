# CPP MODULES

## Summary

This repository contains the modules of the C++ piscine from 42 School.

Each module is in a folder named `cppXX` where `XX` is the number of the module.

The higher the number, the more advanced the module is.

In all of these exercises, I have adhered to good coding practices, ensuring that my code is clean, readable, and efficient. All my code has been compiled using the `c++` compiler with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`, and it has been confirmed to compile with the `-std=c++98` flag as well.

## Module 03 - Inheritance

Key learning outcomes of this module include understanding and applying the principle of inheritance to derive classes from other classes, the exercises are based on game design principles and include:

- **Exercise 01:** Implementing and testing inheritance
